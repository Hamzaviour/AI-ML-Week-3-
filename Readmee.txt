README File for All Three Tasks
Overview
This repository contains Python implementations for three machine learning tasks:

Task 1: Disease Prediction - Predict heart disease using structured data.
Task 2: Patient Readmission Prediction - Determine the likelihood of hospital readmission.
Task 3: Cancer Detection - Classify histopathological images using CNNs.
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, tensorflow
